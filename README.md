Zookeeper bot from HyperSkill's introdcution to Java track

This simple bot is one of the many projects from HyperSkill's introduction to Java track while I try to brush up my fundamentals for microservices role at OCBC.
The bot can take user input and do the following:
  - parse String input into integer
  - Call different habitats based on String objects within an array
  - Repeated request for user-input using a do-while loop
  - Exit the program upon user typing "exit"
